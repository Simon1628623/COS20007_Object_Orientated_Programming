//header you use what it knows or what it can do

pointers

pointer that points to int doesn't hold value but address
creates space for 5 ints then get the address for them
int* intPointer = new int[5];

//dereference to access value inside pointer
*intPointer[1] = 5;

go to location of pointer and perform addSHape method at the position
drawing->addSHape()

//delete memory address(pointer)
delete intPointer

if you create something you need something to delete it



//get
int Shape::getX()
{
	return _x;
}
//set
//    shape class
void Shape::setX(int x)
{
	_x = x;
}

//destructor
Shape::~methodname();
